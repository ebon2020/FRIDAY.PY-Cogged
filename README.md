# FRIDAY.PY
This is the first iteration of the FRIDAY discord bot, a bot meant to make SKU management, variant scraping, NFT information gathering, and SNKRS account group picking intuitive and easy. By including this bot in your discord server, it makes it easy to find variants of Shopify products via the Shopify Scraping feature, it also makes it easy to look up SKUs on footsites using the Footsite Scraping module, which will detect if Bot Protection is enabled on a certain SKU, indicating its impending release. Also, each user in your server can store their own automation SKU list via the Database Management system built into the bot. These SKUs can be reached at any time, and can be kept private if the user wishes to do so. Lastly, via the OpenSea API, FRIDAY has an NFT scraping feature, which will return useful statistics about any collection OpenSea has on their platform.

# Here's what's up for the future.
    - I'll be implementing an NFT investment tracker that will take a collection, the number in the collection and the price you bought it for, and can return how your investment is holding by summarizing your hold up until now. No more spreadsheets. Look for this in the 1.3 update.
